## Notes

- **Dynamics folder is empty**: Current sample has no MD/phonon calculations, indicating potential gap in initial selection criteria
- **Workflow name variations**: Both CamelCase (GeometryOptimization) and snake_case (geometry_optimization) variants exist in NOMAD metadata
- **Processing status**: All NOMAD examples are successfully processed, intentionally excluding failed/problematic entries for baseline validation tests
- **Available properties overlap**: Some entries have multiple properties (e.g., both DOS and geometry_optimization), categorized by primary purpose
- **Parser test metadata**: Each parser test includes a metadata.json file documenting its source and purpose
